certainly(1) -- create self-signed certificates with ease
==========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

certainly [`--std` | `--double-std`] [`--ca` <name>] <domain> [<domain>...]

certainly [`--std` | `--double-std`] `--make-ca` <name>

certainly --inspect <certificate>

## DESCRIPTION

Creates a self-signed certficate and key with one or more domains associated, for web development use.

By default, files named after the first domain given are written in the current directory, but flags can be passed to output to standard pipes instead.

With the `--ca` option, issues a certificate signed by a "CA" instead. The CA certificate/key pair can be created with _certainly_ as well.

The inspect option instead reads a certificate file and outputs terse information about it: whether it's self-signed, its dates, and the domains it covers.

Files are written and read in PEM format.

## OPTIONS

* <domain>:
A domain to add to the certificate. The first such domain will also be the certificate's _common name_.

* `--std`:
Outputs first the key then the certificate to STDOUT.

* `--double-std`:
Outputs the key to STDERR, and the certificate to STDOUT. This is useful to write both files to a custom location efficiently, such as: `certainly --double-std domain.test > test.crt 2> test.key`.

* `--ca` <name>:
Uses the certificate/key pair _<name>.crt_ and _<name>.key_ to sign the created certificate instead of self-signing.

* `--make-ca` <name>:
Creates a certificate/key pair suitable for issuing instead of a web certificate.

* `--inspect` <certificate>:
Reads the <certificate> (in PEM format), prints some information about it, and exits.

## EXAMPLES

Create a self-signed certificate for test.domain:

    $ certainly test.domain
    Writing test.domain.key
    Writing test.domain.crt

Create a self-signed certificate for several domains:

    $ certainly test.domain test.place test.pizza
    Writing test.domain.key
    Writing test.domain.crt

Output a new key and certificate:

    $ certainly --std test.app

Write a key and certificate to custom locations:

    $ certainly --double-std test.space 2> moon-key.pem > moon-cert.pem

Show some information about a certificate:

    $ certainly --inspect test.ninja.crt
    Self-signed certificate
    Created on:   Sep  5 21:17:47 2018 GMT
    Expires on:   Sep  2 21:17:47 2028 GMT
    Domains:
     - test.ninja
     - test.green
     - test.red
     - test.technology
     - rofl.lmao.lol

Use OpenSSL to view all information about a certificate:

    $ openssl x509 -text -in test.wtf.crt
    Certificate:
        Data:
            Version: 3 (0x2)
    ...

Create a CA pair and sign a new certificate:

    $ certainly --make-ca ca.test
    Writing ca.test.key
    Writing ca.test.crt

    $ certainly --ca ca.test test.party
    Writing test.party.key
    Writing test.party.crt

    $ certainly --inspect test.party.crt
    Certificate signed by ca.test
    Created on:   Sep  6 01:41:25 2018 GMT
    Expires on:   Sep  3 01:41:25 2028 GMT
    Domains:
     - test.party

## DETAILS

Certificates are generated with a common subject of:

* C (Country): `ZZ`

* ST (State): `AA`

* O (Organisation): `Certainly`

They use elliptical curve cryptograpy using `prime256v1`, hashed with `SHA-512`.

This generates small files (easier to inspect and manipulate) and uses algorithms that are well supported by modern tools (browsers, servers, etc) while being up-to-date with security best practices.
